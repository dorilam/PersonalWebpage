        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="lam2.jpg" width="300" height="600" />
        <p>I'm a junior at the University of Oklahoma. I am currently double majoring in management information systems and accounting. On campus, I am a strong student leader. I enjoy involving myself in a number of student organizations such as the JCPenney Leadership Program, Phi Delta Alpha Sorrority, Inc, Ronnie K. Irani Center for the Creation of Economic Wealth, and the Multicultural Greek Counil.</p>

        <p>This semester, I'm interning with ICCEW. This experience has allowed me to work with a team of four consultants to come up with a projected business and financial plan for our client, NextThought.</p>

        <h2>Phi Delta Alpha</h2>

        <p>Phi Delta Alpha is the first Asian-interest sorority created in the state of Oklahoma. It was officially founded on February 4, 2002 by 14 ambitious women. They dedicated their hearts and souls into creating an everlasting sisterhood, which would provide Asian-American women the chance to enter into the Greek system. 16 years later, the Alpha chapter of Phi Delta Alpha has successfully crossed 154 noble women into the sorority.</p>
        <p>As a member of this organization, I've help countless roles in order to stand close to the pillars of the sorrority and seek ways to improve its functions. Some roles I've held include being Director of Social Affairs and New Memeber Education.</p>
